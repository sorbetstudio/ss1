At Vesta we are passionate about sourcing, roasting, and brewing the highest quality specialty coffees from around the world.  We believe in building relationships with farmers and exporters at origin who support sustainable growing practices. Quality and service is in our DNA, and is evident with every sip of our coffee, every bag shipped, and every relationship that helps us along the way. 

Coffee became a more profitable fruit to grow in their farm, which led to the creation of Cedral. Cedral, which means cedar tree in Spanish, was overrun by cedar trees in the past, but in the mid 1900’s a large company from Spain came to the area and cut down the trees where the farm resides today. It’s promising to see the Solis family replanting and farming sustainably to recuperate the land. The micro climate, coupled with the habitat created by planting various other plants produces excellent coffees. The high altitude, great cloud coverage, strong sun rays, wind movement and frequent rains lend well to the young catuai plants (only 7 years old!) growing in the fertile soil of the Dota Valley.
