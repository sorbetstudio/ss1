      <description>At Vesta we are passionate about sourcing, roasting, and brewing the highest quality specialty coffees from around the world. We believe in building relationships with farmers and exporters at origin who support sustainable growing practices. Quality and service is in our DNA, and is evident with every sip of our coffee, every bag shipped, and every relationship that helps us along the way.&#xA;Coffee became a more profitable fruit to grow in their farm, which led to the creation of Cedral.</description>
